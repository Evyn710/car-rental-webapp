A repository for the fall 2021 CPSC 471 final project

Instructions on how to run:

1. Included in the project folder are multiple virtual environment folders. The folders named venv are for linux and the folder named venv-windows (currently in a zip file) is for windows.
2. Activate the python virtual environment via the commandline. If you are on windows, make sure you have virtualenv installed with pip and run with administrator. If you are still having issues, try Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process if activate is saying you don't have permissions, or try the linux version.
   
3. To run the api, run the api.py file in the API folder with python3
4. To run the web page, run the run.py file in the webApp folder with python3 <br>
   NOTE: if none of the above works, last ditch attempt is to install all the needed dependencies outside of the venv <br>
   Also make sure you are using the right venv folder on linux, the ones in the respective directory for what you are trying to run
